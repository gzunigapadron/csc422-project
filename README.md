## **Welcome to our Wildlife Classification Data Mining Project!**

Our project aims to classify images of wildlife into various categories using different versions of Convolutional Neural Networks. We have collected a large dataset of images of various animals and birds, and trained several models to accurately classify them. Our project repository contains 5 Jupyter notebooks, each using a different aproach to train the model.

To get started, we suggest utilizing the Jupyter notebooks linked in our [Google Drive shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1n_Uxyi0xfNNpMcAnAR9flBCrenHUUbkG). In the event that you are unable to access the datasets used in these notebooks, we recommend creating a copy of the DataMiningProject folder and modifying the path to reference your personal copy of the folder in each notebook.
